IMPORTANT: This project already has a working codebase and UI.
Only EXTEND and MODIFY existing components, hooks, and logic.
Do NOT regenerate, restructure, or rebuild the application.
Preserve all current functionality, routing, styling, and data structures.

1. Smart Avatar Based on BMI, Age & Gender

Automatically assign a profile avatar based on:

BMI category (normal / overweight / obese visual body type)

Gender (male / female)

Age group (child / adult)

If BMI is above normal, avatar should visibly reflect overweight body type.

Avatar must auto-update when BMI changes.

2. Global AI Assistant Bubble

Make the AI assistant chat bubble globally accessible on all screens.

Persist across route/navigation changes.

3. AI Assistant Precision Upgrade

Responses must be precise, problem-first, and concise.

Response structure:

Direct answer to the main problem

Secondary guidance only if relevant

Avoid generic or obvious responses.

Patient-friendly, professional tone.

No prescriptions or guaranteed diagnosis.

4. Rewards & Points System (Extended Logic)

Daily task completion = 10 points

Minimum redemption threshold = 10,000 points

1000 points = ₹10 (conversion logic)

7-day streak = 50 bonus points

30-day streak = 100 bonus points

Successful referral = 100 points

Additional requirements:

Points can be redeemed only after reaching 10,000 points

Show total points clearly

Track streaks accurately

Add a Referral option in the Profile tab

5. Image Upload & Disease Identification in AI Assistant

Add image upload inside AI chat.

After upload:

Classify the image

Identify possible disease or health issue

Explain reasoning briefly

Provide general precautionary advice

Display disclaimer: Not a medical diagnosis

Do not store images permanently.

6. Enhanced Profile Setup (Medical History)

Add input fields for:

Past diseases

Allergies

Current medical conditions

Use this data to personalize AI responses.

7. Text Selection Visibility (Accessibility Fix)

Ensure selected text is always readable:

Light mode → black/high-contrast text

Dark mode → clearly visible high-contrast text

Apply globally, including AI chat.

8. Medicine Reminder Alarm

Play an audible alarm sound when reminder time is reached.

Alarm must trigger regardless of which screen is open.

Constraints & Safety

Preventive healthcare only

No prescriptions or definitive diagnosis

Maintain existing UX and UI

Implement all enhancements carefully without breaking the current app.
