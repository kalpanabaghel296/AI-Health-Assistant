IMPORTANT:
This project already has a working codebase and UI.
Only EXTEND and FIX existing logic.
Do NOT rebuild, restructure, or redesign the app.
Preserve all current routing, UI, and data models.

1. Fix Reward Points Update Issue (Critical)

Problem:

When a user completes Daily Goals, points are not reflected immediately in the Profile/Dashboard.

Required Fix:

Ensure reward points update instantly when:

A daily goal/task is marked completed

Points logic:

Each completed daily task = +10 points

Use a single source of truth for points (user state or global store).

Sync reward updates across:

Daily Goals

Dashboard

Profile section

Ensure UI re-renders immediately after point updates (no refresh required).

2. Improve Reward State Management

Centralize reward/points state:

Avoid duplicate calculations in multiple components.

Persist points per user session.

Prevent duplicate rewards for the same task/day.

Ensure reward state remains consistent across navigation.

3. Add Alarm Sound for Medicine & Appointment Reminders

Required Behavior:

When reminder time is reached:

Play an audible alarm sound

Show visual notification (toast or modal)

Alarm must trigger:

Even if the user is on another screen inside the app

Alarm sound should:

Be patient-friendly (soft but noticeable)

Auto-stop after user acknowledges reminder

Implementation Guidance:

Use browser-supported audio APIs.

Use a background timer or interval to check reminder times.

Ensure alarm works for:

Medicine reminders

Doctor appointment reminders

4. Safety & UX Constraints

Do NOT block the UI with alerts.

Do NOT play alarm repeatedly once acknowledged.

Maintain existing UI theme and accessibility.

Keep logic efficient and lightweight.

Expected Outcome

Completing a daily goal instantly increases reward points.

Updated points appear immediately on Profile and Dashboard.

Reminder alarms play exactly at scheduled time.

No regression in existing features.

Apply fixes carefully and ensure the app remains stable and user-friendly.
